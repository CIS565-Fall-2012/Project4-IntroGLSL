IMAGE PROCESSING AND WEBGL


PART 1:

- Implemented all necessary image processing filters.
- In the 3 extra filters, I have made custom filters:
	- The first filter keeps only the portions of image that 	have high luminance and does not show the rest of the image. 	This gives a kind of comic book effect with black and white 	images.
	- The other 2 filters just output a component of the colors 	(red and magenta). This is nothing special so I don't think 	I will get any points for these.


PART 2:

- Implemented the sine wave and simplex vertex shaders.
- My custom implementation has a sine of exponent which gives a nice cloth-in-the-wind like effect.
